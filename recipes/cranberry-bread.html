        <li>Flour: This cranberry walnut bread starts with two cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Sugar: A little less than a cup of white sugar (Â¾ cup, to be exact) gives you all the sweetness you need.</li>
        <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt brings out the other flavors in this cranberry walnut bread.</li>
        <li>Cranberries: Fresh cranberries are best, but you can use dried cranberries in a pinch.</li>
        <li>Nuts: This recipe calls for walnuts, but you could substitute pecans if you like.</li>
        <li>Orange: You'll need the juice and the zest.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the quick bread batter together and adds moisture.</li>
        <li>Oil: A neutral oil, like vegetable oil, provides moisture without adding flavor.</li>
    <ol>
        <li> Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Add walnuts and stir.</li> 
        <li> Mix the wet ingredients: Mix the juice, egg, oil, and zest together in a bowl. Stir the dry mix into the wet mix, then add the cranberries.</li> 
        <li> Bake the bread: Transfer the batter to a prepared loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li> 
    </ol>
